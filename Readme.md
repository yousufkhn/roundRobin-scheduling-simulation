# Round Robin Scheduling Simulation

This project is a simulation of the Round Robin scheduling algorithm, implemented in C++. It aims to generate a set of processes with random arrival times and CPU burst times, run the Round Robin scheduling algorithm for a specified duration, and record the average waiting time and turnaround time for each process. The results will be compared with the ideal scenario of a perfect scheduler.
